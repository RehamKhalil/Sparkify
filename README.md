# Sparkify Project
This project is the final Capstone project of the Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree program. The aim is to learn how to manipulate realistic datasets with Spark to engineer relevant features for predicting churn. Input data is related to the fictive music streaming service Sparkify (similar to Spotify and Pandora).

# Installation
The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3. See the requirements.txt file for details about library versions.
